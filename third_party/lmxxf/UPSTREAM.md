This is a **vendored source closure**, not a git submodule and not the `analysis/` clone.
Files are copied byte-for-byte from that commit unless a later commit in this tree
says otherwise.

`tools/sync-lmxxf-upstream.ps1` pins sync to `-UpstreamRef` (default `origin/main`) via
`git archive` into a temp tree — the upstream working-tree branch cannot poison the copy.
Pass `-SkipUpstreamFetch` / `-AllowOfflineUpstream` when fetch is unavailable. Live
`shaders/*.hlsl` are mirror-cleaned to the top-level glue set only (`dx12-network/` is not vendored).

## OURS (do not follow upstream on sync)

Local product / stability ownership. `tools/sync-lmxxf-upstream.ps1` **preserves** the vendor files below by default; pass the named switch only when intentionally refreshing from upstream and re-applying local patches (fail-closed).

| Path | Owner note | Sync default |
|---|---|---|
| `Development/HIP/hip_d3d12_bridge.h` | Queue drain / ClearOutput / zero-residual safeguards and extra passes for `LmxxfNrRuntime` | **Preserve**; `-UpdateBridge` to overwrite + re-patch |
| `src/native_rgb_reflect.h` | Drop unused `#include "native_split.h"` so codec builds without the D3D12 network body | **Preserve**; `-UpdateReflect` to overwrite + re-drop include |
| `OptiScaler-…/dlssnr/backend/lmxxf_runtime/` (`LmxxfNrRuntime.cpp`, `LmxxfNrApi.h`, …) | OptiScaler bridge + C-ABI runtime (this product) | **Not in sync list** — never copied from upstream |
| `third_party/lmxxf/modules/` + local `hip/SHA256SUMS` gfx1201 rows | Shipping COMGR `.hsaco` built here (upstream git has no hsaco) | Built/refreshed by sync modules path, not taken from upstream git |

## FOLLOW (track upstream performance / recipe)

Synced from `-UpstreamRef` (default `origin/main`) via `git archive`. Intent: author kernel / geometry / codec / glue improvements.

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `hip/*.hip`, `hip/build-modules.ps1`, `hip/rtc_compile.cpp`, upstream `hip/SHA256SUMS` recipe rows | gfx1201 HIP kernels (then local rebuild of modules) |
| `Development/HIP/hip_api.h` | Loaded HIP ABI |
| `Development/HIP/hip_device_properties.h` | Device props |
| `Development/HIP/hip_reference_network.h` | HIP network (plus tiny local `#include <algorithm>` patch) |
| `Development/HIP/packed_weights.h` | Weight packing |
| `src/native_hip_network.h` | HIP entry |
| `src/native_network_geometry.h` | 720 / 900 / 1080 tiers + FIT_LARGE helpers |
| `src/native_input_geometry.h` | Input viewport / fit |
| `src/native_lab_paths.h` | Paths, typed views, weight IO |
| `src/native_game_codec.h` | Scene encode / decode host |
| `src/native_game_rgb_input.h`, `src/native_rgb_texture.h` | RGB IO |
| `src/native_device_identity.h`, `src/native_pinned_resource.h`, `src/native_pso.h`, `src/native_shader_cache.h` | Supporting glue |
| `src/native_temporal_feed.h`, `src/native_temporal_coordinates.h`, `src/native_temporal_sample.h` | Motion vectors to coordinates, history warp (Patch D drops an unused include from the feed) |
| `shaders/*.hlsl` (top-level live glue only) | D3D12 glue; mirror-cleaned; `dx12-network/` not vendored |

## Patches applied in this tree

### General Headers
1. `NativeLabRoot()` still matches upstream (may fall back to `D:\\DLSSNR-Lab` when no `DLSS5-AMD\\native-game-flags.txt` is found). Product installs write that flags file beside the game.
2. `native_rgb_reflect.h` (**pinned**): dropped unused `native_split.h`; codec compiles without the D3D12 network body. Sync preserves it unless `-UpdateReflect`.
3. `SetNoise` skips the 201 MiB buffer when `fast_prefix` is on.
4. `#include <algorithm>` for MinGW/MSVC `std::sort` / `std::min` in `hip_reference_network.h` and `hip_d3d12_bridge.h`.

### `Development/HIP/hip_d3d12_bridge.h` (Vendor-Pinned & Patched)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> See **OURS** above. Sync preserves this header by default; only pass `-UpdateBridge` when intentionally pulling upstream bridge changes and verifying re-applied patches (fail-closed anchors + marker check).

### `src/native_rgb_reflect.h` (Vendor-Pinned & Patched)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> See **OURS** above. Upstream still `#include "native_split.h"` even though `NativeRgbReflect` does not use it; that would pull the excluded D3D12 network body. Sync preserves our header (include already removed) unless `-UpdateReflect`, which re-copies upstream then drops the include again.

1. **Queue Drain Completion Verification**: In `WaitForSubmittedWork()`, additionally checks `fence->GetCompletedValue() >= target` after `WaitForSingleObject` returns `WAIT_OBJECT_0`, preventing queue drain race conditions.
2. **Zero-Residual Fallback Path**:
   - `ClearOutputAsync()`: clears `output.mapped` via `hipMemsetAsync` and synchronizes the HIP stream.
   - `ClearOutputD3D12(targetQueue)`: synchronizes HIP stream first, then stages a zero-clear to `output.resource` on the target queue via a dedicated upload staging buffer (`zero_upload`), fences completion, and waits safely.
   - `ClearOutput(targetQueue)`: unified entry point for a submitted producer and an unsubmitted consumer. It validates the target queue, clears output, and advances the bridge to the phase appropriate for whether the consumer was already recorded. The caller must drain other queues that previously used the output.
3. **Clear Resource Lifecycle Management**:
   - Creates dedicated `zero_upload`, `clear_alloc`, and `clear_cmd` only on the first D3D12 fallback; normal `Create()` has no clear-only allocations.
   - Releases resources in destructor only after ensuring all in-flight GPU work has completed (`clear_submission_unconfirmed` check and `WaitForSubmittedWork()`).
4. **Failure State Recovery in Submit Notification**:
   - In `NotifyOutputSubmittedIfRecorded()`, if `failed` is true, safely resets `phase = Phase::Ready` without asserting `QueueContract`, allowing safe teardown or re-initialization.
5. **Runtime Opt-In and Consumer Queue Lifetime**:
   - `LMXXF_NR_CREATE_FLAG_ZERO_OUTPUT_FALLBACK` enables recovery in the C ABI; the default keeps strict enqueue errors.
   - Queue mismatch recovery drains both the original session queue and the target producer queue before HIP zeroing. The Runtime retains the consumer queue and drains it before frame reuse or destruction.
6. **Extra passes**:
   - `EnqueueAfterProducer` takes a pass count (`LmxxfNrFrameInfo::passes`, 1 to 3). Every pass but the last runs the network and then copies its RGB output rows into the RGBA input with `hipMemcpy2DAsync`, which keeps the input's alpha. The function is resolved from the loaded HIP runtime, so `hip_api.h` stays as upstream has it.
   - `RecordPassInputCopy` gives each pass its own history buffer (`pass_history`, created on first use), and in that mode every pass but the last also copies its output into `pass_output` for `PassOutput`, which the runtime turns into the next frame's history. `RecordOutputReadable` makes those outputs readable along with the last one.

### Patch D: `src/native_temporal_feed.h`
Upstream includes `native_split.h` (the D3D12 network body) without using it. The sync script drops the include after every copy.

## Shipping modules (`.hsaco`)

Upstream **does not** publish `.hsaco` on git (`/release/` is gitignored; no GitHub release assets for modules).
Release zips copy `third_party/lmxxf/modules` as-is; GitHub Actions does **not** rebuild HIP kernels.

`tools/sync-lmxxf-upstream.ps1` therefore:

- syncs hip *sources* + `SHA256SUMS` from upstream git;
- by default runs `hip/build-modules.ps1 -Targets gfx1201` into a local build dir, then copies into `third_party/lmxxf/modules`;
- or accepts an explicit `-ModulesPath` to already-built flat gfx1201 `.hsaco`;
- **fails closed** if hip recipes change but modules do not, or modules disagree with `hip/SHA256SUMS` `gfx1201/` entries.

Use `-SkipModules -AllowStaleModules` only for intentional header-only syncs. Use `-NoBuildModules` with `-ModulesPath` when modules were built offline.

## Upstream Contribution & Decoupling Roadmap

1. **Keep Recovery Policy in Runtime**:
   - `network`, `output.mapped`, and `network->Stream()` are private within `D3D12Bridge`; its public `ClearOutput` is the minimal safe transport primitive.
   - The C ABI Runtime decides when to invoke that primitive and owns the cross-queue drain contract. The upstream contribution should include both layers.
2. **Instance Config Refactor**:
   - Process-global geometry/env -> instance config.
3. **Proxy Forwarding**:
   - Host P1: List1-10 command-list proxy forward (then hooks). Not this vendor tree.

## Runtime ABI (this tree)

C ABI in `include/LmxxfNrApi.h`. MSVC (primary) or MinGW (fallback) `tools/build-lmxxf-runtime.cmd` compiles the HIP bridge and codec into `LmxxfNrRuntime.dll`.

- Modules: `third_party/lmxxf/modules` (COMGR gfx1201 hsaco, tracked in git; built from current `hip/` + local COMGR (see modules/README.md Commit Base)).
- Weights: `LMXXF_WEIGHTS_DIR` tiled assets (not 0.24.2 `HIP/`).
- `QueryCapabilities.hip_ready` stays **0**. Product wiring lives in OptiScaler `lmxxf_runtime` / `LmxxfWired()` (not this vendor doc alone).
